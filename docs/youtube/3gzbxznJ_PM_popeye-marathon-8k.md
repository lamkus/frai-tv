Notes:
- These timestamps are a draft skeleton from `docs/METADATA_POPEYE_MARATHON_3gzbxznJ_PM.txt`.
- To finalize “Netflix-grade” chapters, replace each timestamp with the exact start time shown in the YouTube player.
- YouTube requires the first timestamp to be 00:00 to enable chapters.

How to get exact times fast (5–10 min):
1) Open the video on YouTube (watch page), set playback speed to 2x.
2) When a new cartoon begins (title card / hard cut), pause.
3) Use "," and "." to step back/forward framewise until you hit the first frame of the new episode.
4) Read the player time (lower-left). Write it into the chapter list.
5) Save description → refresh page → confirm chapters show up.
